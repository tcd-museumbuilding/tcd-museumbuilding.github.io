          <h1 class="vd-title">Dr. Patrick Wyse Jackson</h1>
          <h2 class="vd-title-s"> Associate Professor in Geology, Curator of the Geological Museum and Librarian in Trinity College Dublin </h2>
          <p class="vd-description">Dr. Wyse Jackson not only offers a geological perspective of the building, discussing the types of marbles and limestones used in its construction, but also narrates some engaging and funny stories that took place within its walls. Having worked in the Museum Building for over twenty years, Dr. Wyse Jackson provides insight into the building’s current state and discusses how its use has changed since it was erected in the 19th century. He reveals some of the most interesting artefacts in the Geological Museum’s collection and voices his thoughts on the future of both the Geological Museum and the Museum Building. He also throws light on the building’s carvings and shares with us some of his favourites.</p>

          <h1 class="vd-title">Dr. Christine Casey</h1>
          <h2 class="vd-title-s"> Associate Professor in Architectural History, Head of Department of History of Art in Trinity College Dublin</h2>
          <p class="vd-description">Dr. Casey discusses the great stair hall adorned with Connemara marble along with other buildings in Dublin that display a similar use of stone and marble.  She describes in detail the types of marble and the architectural fashions of the Victorian period.  Considerable mention goes to the Irish master stonemasons John and James O'Shea and the influence of Ruskin whose ideas inspired the architecture of the Museum Building. The state of Irish architecture in the Victorian period is addressed.  Dr. Casey also discusses the Museum Building in relation to other buildings on Trinity campus, past and present, including the Berkeley Library and the Old Library.</p>

          <h2 class="vd-title-s"> Visiting Research Fellow at the School of Engineering in Trinity College Dublin</h2>
          <p class="vd-description">Dr. Cox uncovers some interesting facts and provides observations about the Museum Building. When did the very first lecture in the building take place? Why is the building now called the Museum Building? How was the building originally heated and ventilated? Who are the young men in the photographs displayed along the staircase? Answers to these and other questions are revealed in the following video.</p>

          <h2 class="vd-title-s"> Strategic Development Officer in Trinity College Dublin</h2>
          <p class="vd-description">Mr. O’Gorman discusses the building’s elaborate decorations and how they reflect the purpose for which it was built. He tells the story of the building as being inscribed into nature as much as it is inscribed into the architectural landscape of Dublin. He brings the building to life in his telling of how swifts nesting in the eaves of the building each summer mirror in a strange and beautiful way the delicate carvings of birds, plants and beasts depicted on the building’s façade. In such a way, “the building that was built to study the natural world has become a part of the natural world through the elements living in it.” </p>
